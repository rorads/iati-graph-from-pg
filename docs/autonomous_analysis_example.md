I'll help you analyze which organizations work downstream from both the US and UK governments. Let's start by examining the Neo4j database schema.

Ran tool
Let me try examining the schema again:

Ran tool
Let's try to get the schema information by running a specific Cypher query instead:

Ran tool
Let's try another approach to examine the schema:

Ran tool
Let me try a simpler query to understand what node labels and relationship types exist:

Ran tool
Let's try getting sample nodes and relationships to understand the structure:

Ran tool
Let me try a very simple query to test if the database is responding:

Ran tool
Let's first verify if the Docker services are running properly by running a terminal command:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```
Let's try using the newer `docker compose` command instead:

```bash
docker compose ps
```
Good, both services are running. Let's examine the Neo4j schema now:

Ran tool
Let's try a basic query to get some node labels:

Ran tool
Let's try again with a simpler query:

Ran tool
Let's fetch the rules about interacting with the databases:

Ran tool
Let's check if the Neo4j service is actually responding. Since we're having issues with the Neo4j MCP tools, let's try connecting to Neo4j via the terminal:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:7474
```
Great, the Neo4j service is responding. Let's try a direct HTTP request to execute a Cypher query:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:neo4j http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (n) RETURN DISTINCT labels(n) AS labels LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
The response indicates authentication issues. Let's check if the database password is set in the environment variables:

```bash
cat .env | grep NEO4J
```
Let's check the docker-compose.yml file for the Neo4j credentials:

```bash
cat docker-compose.yml | grep NEO4J_AUTH
```
Now we know the Neo4j password is "dev_password". Let's try our query again with the correct credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (n) RETURN DISTINCT labels(n) AS labels LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
Great! Now let's try to get the relationship types in the graph:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS relationshipType LIMIT 10"}]}'
```
Now let's check if the Neo4j MCP tools work with the correct credentials:

Ran tool
It seems we're still having issues with the MCP tools. Let's continue with our analysis using direct curl commands. Let's look for US and UK government organizations:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.name CONTAINS \"United States\" OR o.name CONTAINS \"US \" OR o.name CONTAINS \"U.S.\" OR o.name = \"USA\" RETURN o.name, o.ref LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Let's search for UK government organizations:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.name CONTAINS \"United Kingdom\" OR o.name CONTAINS \"UK \" OR o.name CONTAINS \"U.K.\" OR o.name CONTAINS \"British\" RETURN o.name LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Let's check what properties are available for our organizations:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.name = \"U.S. Agency for International Development\" RETURN properties(o) AS properties LIMIT 1"}]}'
```
Let's also check what properties are available for the UK government:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.name = \"UK - Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\" RETURN properties(o) AS properties LIMIT 1"}]}'
```
Now let's find all UK government departments, using the "GB-GOV" pattern:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" RETURN o.name, o.organisationidentifier ORDER BY o.organisationidentifier LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
And similarly for US government departments:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (o:PublishedOrganisation) WHERE o.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" RETURN o.name, o.organisationidentifier ORDER BY o.organisationidentifier LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Now let's look at the relationship schema. Let's check the properties of some of the relationships:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH ()-[r:FUNDS]->() RETURN properties(r) AS properties LIMIT 1"}]}'
```
Let's check the properties of the FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION relationship:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH ()-[r:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->() RETURN properties(r) AS properties LIMIT 1"}]}'
```
Let's examine the PARTICIPATES_IN relationship:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH ()-[r:PARTICIPATES_IN]->() RETURN properties(r) AS properties LIMIT 1"}]}'
```
Now that we understand the schema better, let's formulate our analysis approach. We're looking for organizations that receive significant funding (either directly or indirectly) from both the US and UK governments.

First, let's identify the downstream organizations that are directly funded by US government departments:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:FUNDS|FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(recipient) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH recipient, SUM(CASE WHEN type(r) = \"FUNDS\" THEN r.total_value_usd ELSE 0 END) + SUM(CASE WHEN type(r) = \"FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION\" THEN r.total_value_usd ELSE 0 END) AS total_funding_usd RETURN recipient.name AS recipient_name, total_funding_usd ORDER BY total_funding_usd DESC LIMIT 20"}]}'
```
We need to fix our query by properly capturing the relationship:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[r:FUNDS|FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(recipient) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH recipient, SUM(CASE WHEN type(r) = \"FUNDS\" THEN r.total_value_usd ELSE 0 END) + SUM(CASE WHEN type(r) = \"FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION\" THEN r.total_value_usd ELSE 0 END) AS total_funding_usd RETURN recipient.name AS recipient_name, total_funding_usd ORDER BY total_funding_usd DESC LIMIT 20"}]}'
```
The recipient names are showing as null. Let's modify our query to get better results:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[r:FUNDS]->(recipient) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" RETURN recipient.name AS recipient_name, recipient.organisationidentifier as recipient_id, us.name as us_gov_dept, r.total_value_usd AS funding_value_usd ORDER BY r.total_value_usd DESC LIMIT 10"}]}'
```
Let's check if we have any FUNDS relationships at all:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH ()-[r:FUNDS]->() RETURN COUNT(r) AS funds_count"}]}'
```
Let's check what types of nodes the FUNDS relationships connect:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (a)-[r:FUNDS]->(b) RETURN DISTINCT labels(a) AS source_labels, labels(b) AS target_labels LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
Let's check the FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION relationships:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (a)-[r:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(b) RETURN DISTINCT labels(a) AS source_labels, labels(b) AS target_labels LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
Let's check the PARTICIPATES_IN relationships:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (a)-[r:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(b) RETURN DISTINCT labels(a) AS source_labels, labels(b) AS target_labels LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
Based on this schema, let's develop a query to find organizations that receive funding downstream from both US and UK government entities. We'll need to trace funding paths from government entities to recipient organizations. 

Let's find organizations that are downstream (up to 3 hops away) from both US and UK government entities:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH path1 = (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION|PARTICIPATES_IN|FUNDS*1..3]->(org) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH org, us MATCH path2 = (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION|PARTICIPATES_IN|FUNDS*1..3]->(org) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" WITH org, us, uk, [p IN relationships(path1) WHERE type(p) IN [\"FUNDS\", \"FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION\"] | p.total_value_usd] AS us_funds, [p IN relationships(path2) WHERE type(p) IN [\"FUNDS\", \"FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION\"] | p.total_value_usd] AS uk_funds WHERE size(us_funds) > 0 AND size(uk_funds) > 0 WITH org, us, uk, reduce(s = 0.0, x IN us_funds | s + x) AS us_total, reduce(s = 0.0, x IN uk_funds | s + x) AS uk_total WHERE us_total > 0 AND uk_total > 0 WITH org, SUM(us_total) AS total_us_funding, SUM(uk_total) AS total_uk_funding WHERE org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation RETURN org.name AS organization, total_us_funding, total_uk_funding, total_us_funding + total_uk_funding AS total_joint_funding ORDER BY total_joint_funding DESC LIMIT 10"}]}'
```
Our query is too complex. Let's simplify our approach. We'll first find organizations that receive funding directly from US government entities, then see which of those also receive funding from UK government entities:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[r1:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(org) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH org, SUM(r1.total_value_usd) AS us_funding WHERE org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation MATCH (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[r2:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(org) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" WITH org, us_funding, SUM(r2.total_value_usd) AS uk_funding RETURN org.name AS organization, us_funding, uk_funding, us_funding + uk_funding AS total_funding ORDER BY total_funding DESC LIMIT 10"}]}'
```
Let's try a different approach using the PARTICIPATES_IN relationship:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act1) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH act1 MATCH (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act2) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" WITH act1, act2 MATCH (org)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act1) WHERE (org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation) AND org.organisationidentifier IS NOT NULL AND NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH org, COUNT(DISTINCT act1) AS us_activities MATCH (org)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act2) WHERE (org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation) AND NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" WITH org, us_activities, COUNT(DISTINCT act2) AS uk_activities RETURN org.name AS organization, org.organisationidentifier AS org_id, us_activities, uk_activities, us_activities + uk_activities AS joint_activities ORDER BY joint_activities DESC LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Let's also look at financial transactions to better understand the monetary values involved:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act1)<-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]-(org) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" AND (org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation) AND org.organisationidentifier IS NOT NULL AND NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" WITH org, COUNT(DISTINCT act1) AS us_activities MATCH (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act2)<-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]-(org) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" AND NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" WITH org, us_activities, COUNT(DISTINCT act2) AS uk_activities, COLLECT(DISTINCT act2) AS uk_acts, COLLECT(DISTINCT act1) AS us_acts MATCH (act)-[ft:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(org) WHERE act IN us_acts WITH org, us_activities, uk_activities, SUM(ft.total_value_usd) AS us_funding MATCH (act)-[ft:FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION]->(org) WHERE act IN uk_acts WITH org, us_activities, uk_activities, us_funding, SUM(ft.total_value_usd) AS uk_funding RETURN org.name AS organization, org.organisationidentifier AS org_id, us_activities, uk_activities, us_funding, uk_funding, us_funding + uk_funding AS total_funding ORDER BY total_funding DESC LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Let's try a simpler approach to get the top organizations that work with both US and UK governments, looking at the funding relationships first:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act1) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" MATCH (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act2) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" MATCH (org)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act1) WHERE (org:PublishedOrganisation OR org:PhantomOrganisation) AND org.organisationidentifier IS NOT NULL AND NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" MATCH (org)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act2) WHERE NOT org.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" RETURN org.name AS organization, org.organisationidentifier AS org_id, COUNT(DISTINCT act1) AS us_activities, COUNT(DISTINCT act2) AS uk_activities, COUNT(DISTINCT act1) * COUNT(DISTINCT act2) AS joint_exposure ORDER BY joint_exposure DESC LIMIT 15"}]}'
```
Let's investigate two specific organizations for more detailed insight:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (org:PublishedOrganisation {organisationidentifier: \"XM-DAC-928\"}) WITH org MATCH (us:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act)<-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]-(org) WHERE us.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"US-GOV\" RETURN us.name AS us_dept, COUNT(act) AS activity_count ORDER BY activity_count DESC LIMIT 5"}]}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -u neo4j:dev_password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (org:PublishedOrganisation {organisationidentifier: \"XM-DAC-928\"}) WITH org MATCH (uk:PublishedOrganisation)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(act)<-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]-(org) WHERE uk.organisationidentifier STARTS WITH \"GB-GOV\" RETURN uk.name AS uk_dept, COUNT(act) AS activity_count ORDER BY activity_count DESC LIMIT 5"}]}'
```
Based on our analysis, I'll now compile a report on organizations with the highest joint exposure to funding from both US and UK governments.

# Organizations with Highest Joint Exposure to US and UK Government Funding

## Methodology

To identify organizations with significant downstream exposure to both US and UK government funding, I analyzed the IATI graph database with the following approach:

1. Identified all organizations with the prefix "US-GOV" for US government departments and "GB-GOV" for UK government departments
2. Found organizations that participate in activities funded by both US and UK government entities
3. Calculated a "joint exposure" metric as the product of US-funded activities and UK-funded activities
4. Examined detailed participation patterns for top organizations

## Key Findings

### Top Organizations by Joint Exposure

The following organizations demonstrate the highest levels of joint participation in activities funded by both US and UK government entities:

1. **World Health Organization (WHO)** - Participates in 2,328 US-funded activities and 1,544 UK-funded activities
2. **Sweden** - Participates in 1,646 US-funded activities and 1,897 UK-funded activities
3. **German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development** - Participates in 1,293 US-funded activities and 1,656 UK-funded activities
4. **United Nations Development Programme** - Participates in 1,010 US-funded activities and 1,397 UK-funded activities
5. **Global Affairs Canada** - Participates in 1,606 US-funded activities and 647 UK-funded activities

### Detailed Analysis: World Health Organization

The WHO shows the highest joint exposure to both countries' funding:

- **US Government Participation:**
  - Primary source: U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) - 2,328 activities
  - Secondary source: U.S. Department of State - 27 activities

- **UK Government Participation:**
  - Primary source: UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office - 1,520 activities
  - Secondary source: UK Department of Health and Social Care - 21 activities
  - Tertiary source: UK Home Office - 9 activities

This suggests the WHO is a critical implementing partner for both countries' international development and health security objectives.

## Observations

1. **Multilateral Organizations Dominate**: UN agencies (WHO, UNDP, WFP, UNAIDS) feature prominently in joint funding, suggesting they serve as preferred vehicles for both countries' international development agendas.

2. **Peer Government Agencies**: National development agencies from other countries (Sweden, Germany, Canada, Australia) also feature in the top list, indicating significant triangular cooperation between the US, UK, and other donor countries.

3. **Humanitarian Focus**: Organizations with humanitarian mandates (UN OCHA, WFP, IOM) feature prominently, suggesting this as a key area of joint US-UK funding priority.

4. **Limited Private Sector Representation**: Only one private foundation (Gates Foundation) appears in the top 15, suggesting that bilateral/multilateral channels remain the dominant vehicles for US-UK joint funding.

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that the international aid ecosystem has several key organizations that are heavily exposed to both US and UK government funding. The prevalence of multilateral organizations at the top of the list suggests these entities serve as important channels for coordinating bilateral priorities from both donor countries.

These findings could help stakeholders understand which organizations would be most affected by policy shifts in either the US or UK development funding landscapes, and identify the most influential implementing partners for both countries' international development objectives.
